The purpose of this project was to prepare analysis of the current cryptocurrencies trading on the market for a hypothetical client preparing to invest in crypocurrencies. 
## Process
First, the data was preprocessed to fit machine learning model. For this project Python and unsupervised machine learning was used and data was clustered into 4 classes. As a result, a scatter plot was created that provided information about the number of coins mined and available supply on the market. This information can potentially be used by anyone interested in entering cryptocurrency market. The analysis can be taken further to analyze classes and idenitfy the most profitable units in each cluster.
